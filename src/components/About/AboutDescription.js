        I’m an evolutionary biologist, studying how species evolve and adapt to
        different environments!

          In my pursuit to understand the branching of the tree of life, I have
          worked with several of its branches (but my favourite are reptiles)
        </b>

        I was born and raised in Portugal and my research had me moving to
        Switzerland for my PhD and, currently, to the USA, where I research
        desert lizards at UCBerkeley, in the Rosenblum Lab.
      </p>

          In 2019, I founded evALLution: an education project to make evolution
          and biodiversity accessible for people with blindness.
        </b>

        I’m a first-generation high school graduate, and believe that a more
        inclusive and holistic education system is key for a sustainable and
        equitable future.

          So, I’m currently working in designing inclusive, culturaly-responsive
          science courses that kindle a true sense of belonging in the tree of
          life, for all!
